                        Semantic Elements are being used to structure the HTML page. It is not only easier
                        for a Developer to understand the structure of the file. It also makes the page
                        more likely more accessible for deabled people. The reader can more easily 
                        understand the webpage and read it out for the person in front of the screen.
                    </p>

                        There are a lot of different Semantic Elements being used in HTML5. Some gerneral ones to
                        structure the webpage are e.g. &lt;header&gt;;&lt;main&gt;;&lt;footer&gt;. <br>
                        But there are more:<br>
                        &lt;nav&gt; for the Navigation menu<br>
                        &lt;article&gt; for the main article of the page<br>
                        &lt;section&gt; is being used for different sections within the article.
                        &lt;aside&gt; for a part that is not really part of the main article. E.g. some 
                        extra information.<br>
                        There are still quite a few more. Some more commonly used than others. But 
                        you get the gerneral idea.
