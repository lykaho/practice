                    <p class="textSection">In the beginning of 2019, we began the project of building a poultry farm together with the members
                        of Kodul Muga Women Cutter. The group members are single mothers whom in most cases have
                        been left without an income to provide for their families. Thanks to the poultry farm, the women had
                        the tools to start up their own businesses today each member has their own poultry from which they
                        get food and money. During the first year, the group shared a larger farm which is now being used as
                        a backup, equipped with a quarantine section in case of diseases.<br><br>
                        We are forever thankful to Nutrado of Sweden for supporting us from the very beginning and for
                        making it possible to get started so quickly.</p>

                    <p class="textSection">Kodul Muga Cup Project is an initiative to prevent girls from dropping out of school as well as reducing the shame, stigma and health problems related to unsafe sanitary products. 
                        <br>
                        During lockdown we were not able to provide neither menstrual cups nor education, so until the beginning of March 2021, we distributed cloth pads to the students in Year 6-8 at Oneno Primary School in Kochia.
                        <br>
                        When the schools reopened in March, our partner organisation from Nairobi visited the students in grade 8 who had their examinations later that month were given menstrual cups and a seminar about safe use and reproductive health. The cups have been a success and the interest is big amongst students and teachers.  By supporting us you take us closer to the goal of giving all girls in the community access to reproductive health and ability to finish their education.
