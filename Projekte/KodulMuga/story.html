                    <p class="textSection">Kodul Muga foundation is a Swedish non-profit organisation, supporting girls and single mothers in the village Kochia in Western Kenya. Our belief is that when girls can finish their education, and mothers have the tools to provide their families with food, school fees and healthcare, the whole society benefits.<br>
                        The foundation was founded in 2018, by Boni Odhiambo Abongo and Elin Wildlock who first met at a Thai boxing camp and began selling earrings and fundraise for water tanks and health insurance for the single women in Kochia.

                    <p class="textSection">The person behind this project is Boniface Odhiambo Abongo, a man who has dedicated his life to help the women in his community. This is his story:
                    </p>
                    <blockquote>
                        “I grow up as an orphan and therefore I have lived with different people in my life. Some were good to me while others were very bad, some denied me food while others fed me. Many people across the globe share my story, so when I started to work, I wanted to give back to my community and started to educate the less fortunate and orphans in my village. Remember, where there is an orphan, there is a widow, so I started to support them with my own salary. I could not manage alone, but luckily, I met a friend while on my vacation to Bali Indonesia. Her name is Elin and since then we have managed to mobilize more people who have come to support my vision in this village.<br> 
Elin has personally visited my home both while I was away and while at home, many thanks Elin! Together we started a project with the women of Kodul Muga, which in the beginning was all about encouraging them to make earrings that were sold in Sweden. Even though we made big sales, it was challenging, therefore, we agreed with Elin to help mobilize more money for poultry farming, which has since developed to each one of our members having their own farms. My vision was to make each family independent so that kids can go to school and get their school fees provided, each family can have at least three meals a day so that each family can medicate. We are almost there, but we still have a lot of challenges before us, such as chicken virus outbreaks, early pregnancies, and lack of school fees. However, we shall continue working towards our goal. I, therefore, want to request each one of you who will come across this site to donate something small or big we will appreciate and pray for you.”
